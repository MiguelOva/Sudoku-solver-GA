So, during our induction period at PMI, we had weekly meetings to discuss the ins and outs of the company and its products. We learned about a range of things - the different product types, the manufacturing processes, the exciting work happening in research and development, PMI's environmental efforts, the company's harm reduction strategies, and the overall goals PMI wants to achieve moving forward.

A significant part of our introduction was the Learning & Development program. This was designed to help us gain the skills we needed for our roles. We had several sessions led by various people. Sérgio gave us a tour of the IT Academy, which is an important hub for tech learning within PMI. Katica explained the business side of things and helped us see where we fit in the larger PMI framework.

Jane walked us through a learning platform called O'Reilly, which is quite beneficial. Sylvia guided us on how to succeed with the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate. We also spent time focusing on our career goals and how to achieve them within PMI.

Throughout the weeks, we were regularly updated by ExploreIT and Raylene. They covered a lot of topics like global induction, marketing strategies, sustainability, how to establish our personal brand, and the importance of a psychologically safe workspace. All this knowledge didn't just make our jobs easier but also helped us better integrate into the PMI community.

In summary, the induction process was extremely valuable. It helped us better understand PMI, its products, and our roles. The Learning & Development program equipped us with the necessary skills for success. Weekly meetings ensured we smoothly transitioned into PMI's culture and operations.
